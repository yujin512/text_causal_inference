Cut does not have any effect on price but can have an effect on \"value.\" Cuts are evenly distributed among differently weighted gems. More work is needed to understand the effects of carat and cut on a gem's price and value. \n",
            "1 It's hard to know what this figure is trying to say\n",
            "2 The above chart shows how various variables or factors change based on the quality of cut. We can see how the cut affects the variables carat, depth, price, table, x, y, and z. Although the graph is a little bit difficult to look at.\n",
            "3 This graph plots diamond carat vs. price, and it doesn't look like there's very much difference between the cut and the way that its price changes with size\n",
            "4 There is a lot going on when it comes to  the effects of carat, cut, and price. Cut does not have any effect on price but can have an effect on \"value.\" Cuts are evenly distributed among differently weighted gems. More work is needed to understand the effects of carat and cut on a gem's price and value. \n",
            "5 Gems with lower quality cuts tend to have a wider variety in depth, although gems generally have the same prices regardless of cut. Also, gems vary in how big they are, usually the bigger the gem the more ideal the cut of the gem. \n",
            "6 Figure 1 shows boxplots for diamonds of different sizes and cuts. The price ranges of 1-2 carat diamonds are generally higher and narrower compared to 0-1 carat diamonds. Interestingly, for smaller (0-1) carat diamonds, the ranking of the middle prices are as follows: fair > good > very good > premium > ideal. Perhaps, since the diamonds are small, it’s hard to tell the difference between the cuts or consumers don’t look too carefully at them. The ideal cut has some outliers that are expensive. For the bigger diamonds, the variability of price ranges are pretty similar for all cuts, and the ideal cut has the highest middle price. \n",
            "7 The greater the carat the more expensive the gem is. Cut seems to have two effects; for smaller gems, better cuts are surprisingly cheaper but for larger gems, better cuts are more expensive. \n",
            "8 This chart is much more elucidating. It shows a clear relationship between the size of a diamond and its price, which rise together in fairly linear fashion within the bulky middle of our dataset. Better cuts of diamond tend to sell for slightly more, but this effect is minuscule compared to the effect of size. \n",
            "\n",
            "There is also an interesting effect in sizes: carats tend to cluster just above a certain cutoff, for example 1.0 carats or 0.3 carats.\n",
            "9 Price is affected by Carat and Cut. Ideal cut has the least price in <1 carat while it has the highest price in 1-2 carat. \n",
            "10 This graph plots the distributions of prices for different cuts and sizes of diamonds. The plots are called box-and whisker plots—the thick middle line in each box shows the median (middle price) for a given cut and carat range, the edges of the box show the first and third quartiles, the lines go to the \"minimum\" and \"maximum\" and the dots are \"outliers.\" It's interesting to see that the smaller diamonds have decreasing median prices for cut along quality, while the larger group are slightly increasing along quality.\n",
            "11 Price is affected by Carat and Cut. Ideal cut has the least price in <1 carat while it has the highest price in 1-2 carat. \n",
            "12 Figure one shows how a diamond's cut and its Carat influence its price. Based on this chart, a diamond's cut tends not to have a huge impact on its price: in fact, for between 0 and 1 carat, a better cut seems to result in a lower average price. The carat does have a big influence, however, with the diamonds between 1 and 2 carats almost always outselling those with between 0 and 1. Finally, there is much more variability in the price of diamonds between 0 and 1 carat, although frankly this might not be so surprising: diamonds of 0.1 vs 0.9 carats are more different than diamonds of 1.1 vs 1.9 carats in my estimation.\n",
            "\n",
            "There is a lot this chart doesn't show, for example whether diamonds of a better cut tend to be smaller within the quantizations shown above in carat size (this might explain why there is no influence between cut and price), however my grandma might not be able to pick up on these complexities. \n",
            "\n",
            "13 There is a very clear (if non-linear!) relationship between the size of a diamond and its price. Cut doesn't really matter. Despite this clear relationship, there is still a lot of noise in price after taking size into account.\n",
            "14 The carat of a diamond -- whether between 0 and 1 or between 1 and 2 -- matters a lot for its price. Diamonds in the higher-carat category sell for 2-3x as much as diamonds in the lower-carat category. Interestingly, the cut of diamonds matters much less, with relatively minor differences between diamonds with different cuts but comparable carat measurements. \n",
            "\n",
            "One interesting pattern to note is that for lower-carat diamonds (between 0 and 1, in the left column of this graph), the quality of a cut seems to have an inverse relationship with price, on average. This means that higher-quality cuts tend to be (though are not always) priced lower. A somewhat opposite pattern shows up with higher-carat diamonds. \n",
            "15 This figure appears to describe the prices of diamonds at different levels of cuts, where the cuts that are farthest to the left are the worst, and those on the far right are the best. The average price is indicated by the horizontal line, and the box around it indicates the 25th and 75th percentile, respectively. It appears that middle of the road cuts have larger ranges of price as compared to the extremes (\"fair\" and \"ideal\"). Surprisingly, in the [0,1] carat range, higher valued cuts are actually less expensive on average than lower valued cuts. In the (1,2] range, the higher valued cuts are more expensive on average, as I would have expected.\n",
            "16 Generally, the higher the carat the more a gem sells for. \n",
            "17 Carat is more significant in influencing price than cut since the cut lines are close together.\n",
            "18 This graph clearly shows that price increases as carat increases, regardless of which cut is considered. It is somewhat challenging to differentiate between cuts, and the data points distract.\n",
            "19 This plot is similar to the previous one, but instead puts Carat on a moving, continuous scale instead of just separating it to two groups. The cut is still separated but instead uses a number of lines that show the average of each of the groups. We can see that in general, the price increases as the number of carats increase. Moreover, the quality of cut also increase the price as well in general.\n"
